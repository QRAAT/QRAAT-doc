External visual inspection:
Solar panels clean, unshaded
QRAAT antenna straight (all 4 elements)
Preamp has all cables connected
Wifi antennas intact, omnis are upright, directionals are pointed in the correct direction
All cables intact, not loose or chewed

Battery box:
Batteries not leaking or puffed out
Check connectors for corrosion

Equipment box:
Check cable ports are sealed
Qurinet router (Soekris board) - Green power light should be on, red light should be off, other green light may be blinking indicating communication
If the QRAAT site is operating:
Pingbrother router/power switch - numbered light 1 should be on and 2 should be off (3 and 4 will probably be on but nothing is attached so that doesn't matter)
FitPC3 computer - Green light in front is on (hard to see), left light on ethernet port should be on right light may be blinking indeicating communication
RMG - Green light should be on, right light should be off but may blink when switching frequency, LCD should display current center frequency.  If red light is solid red and/or LCD displays "No Lock" turn off site and then turn back on, see below.  If red light persists more in-depth troubleshooting is needed.
If the QRAAT site is not operating:
Pingbrother router/power switch - numbered light 2 should be on and 1 should be off (3 and 4 will probably be on but nothing is attached so that doesn't matter)
FitPC3 computer - No lights should be on
RMG - No lights should be on

Reseting Qurinet router:
Unplug power cord from unit, wait 5 seconds, plug back in
Green power light and red light will come on
Red light will go off in a few seconds
Takes about 2 minutes to boot
At some sites (depending on the software version) the wifi isn't able to connect for an indeterminate amount of time

It is advised to not have QRAAT running when doing maintenance or moving cables and equipment
It is easiest to turn off site from control interface on the server.

Turning off QRAAT:
If FitPC3 is on, push power button on FitPC3, front green light and ethernet lights should go off fairly immediately
Unplug power cord from FitPC3
Unplug power cord from RMG
Unplug power cord from Pingbrother router
Unplug power cord from Qurinet router(if need be)
Remove fuse (if need be, advised if working on the batteries)

Turning on QRAAT:
Replace fuse (if need be)
Plug power cord into Qurinet router (if need be)
Plug power cord into Pingbrother router, green lights will flash, wait until solid to proceed, all 4 should be on
Plug in RMG, it won't immediately turn on
Plug in FitPC3, if front green light or ethernet port light doesn't come on check pingbrother light number 1 is on and press power button
If site was running, after a few seconds the computer should turn on the RMG (by turning pingbrother light 2 off) and start running
If site was off the computer should turn itself off.

"Push the button" to fix power error (computer doesn't turn on when controlled by the Pingbrother):
If FitPC3 front green light and/or ethernet port lights are on this may indicate a different problem, either bring the computer in for troubleshooting or to reboot push power button to turn computer off, wait 5 seconds, push power button again to turn computer on, lights should come on.  
Otherwise, push power button on the FitPC3 to turn computer on.
If pingbrother light 1 isn't green, unplug FitPC3, unplug Pingbrother, wait 5 seconds, plug in Pingbrother, wait until lights are solid, plug in FitPC3.  If FitPC3 lights didn't come on, push power button.
The computer may turn itself off after a couple of minutes depending on the system control but that is fine.
