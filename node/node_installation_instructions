-At this stage I had to mount the USB as a CD-Rom.  This may be fixed in other versions.

Hostname: QRAAT-A (or next letter, currently last one used was J)
Full user name: RMG Remote Site A
username: rmg
password: (same password as all the other ones)

Install security updates automatically
Install openssh
Install Grub on master boot record

-After installation done, with internet
:$ sudo apt-get update
:$ sudo apt-get upgrade
:$ sudo apt-get install git
:$ sudo apt-get autoremove

:$ git clone https://github.com/QRAAT/QRAAT.git
:$ QRAAT/node/etc/build-gnuradio
-for large disks this should just work, for smaller disks one has to install the pieces seperately and delete the source code once each one is installed to have enough room.

:$ QRAAT/build_qraat install node

:$ cp QRAAT/node/etc/80-serial-usb.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/80-serial-usb.rules

:$ cp QRAAT/node/etc/rmg_power_control /etc/sudoers.d/rmg_power_control

Edit /etc/ntp.conf to only use the QRAAT server (currently 10.1.1.57) as the ntp server to sync to
- "server 10.1.1.57 iburst"

Add QRAAT/node/etc/crontab_node lines to crontab

Append QRAAT/node/etc/ramdisk to /etc/fstab

Add QRAAT public sshkey to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys


Before making an image:
Delete /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
- this is the current NIC hardware which will be different on the new fitPC3.  If this files doesn't exist, Ubuntu creates it at start up.  This makes eth0 work correctly.
Change /etc/network/interfaces to use sane default IP address (probably should use DHCP)


To make image:
Boot into live version of linux
plug in and mount (if need be) removeable media
copy image to removeable media
- :$ dd if=/dev/sda of=/mnt/removeable_media


To load image on target:
Boot into live version of linux
plug in and mount (if need be) removeable media
copy image to removeable media
- :$ dd of=/dev/sda if=/mnt/removeable_media
boot target
update /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname to unique name
update /etc/network/interfaces with site ip


To add new site on QRAAT server:
Add entry to /etc/hosts
Add entry to ~/.ssh/config
Add entry to /rmg_server/sitelist.csv
Add entry to site table in qraat database
Test ping and ssh
rmg updatetx
