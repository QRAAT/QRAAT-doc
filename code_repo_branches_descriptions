QRAAT Repo:
master - installed on qraat server and vm14
       - will be installed on nodes soon
       - covariance is broken from position estimation api changes / currently turned off
       - website entry pages broken from reordering / Peggy tasked to fix

normalization_analyses - Gene's code for looking at various position estimation schemes

xml_list - changing from csv list of transmitters to an xml doc
         - Can read and run xmllist on Node
         - missing write from database functionality

est_classification - Gene's thesis work for machine learning classification of est records

covariance_analysis - Eder's work on plotting covariance data

correlation_detector - very old work on testing a correlation detector to replace the time-matched power filter in the detctor, it didn't work any better at the time

cont_cov - continuous covariance recording for direction finding on telemetry tags.  I don't think this works with gnuradio 3.7

gnuradio3.7 - to be delete once I install master on the nodes

QRAAT-doc Repo:
master - documentation on QRAAT

sim Repo:
master - Chris's thesis work for position estimation covariance simulation

time-filter Repo:
master - Chris's work on the time filter for est records.  This was a continuation of Sean's efforts.  The final result should be in QRAAT:master in rmg_estfilter.  Although this is run in the processing, the results are ignored.  Only the prefiltering stage is used.

qraat-node-inst Repo:
master - Chris's instructions on how to install the software on the nodes.  This has changed some and I should have that written up elsewhere.
